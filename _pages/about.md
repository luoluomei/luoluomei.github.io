Welcome to my webpage! 
======
I'm Iris, a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis, where I'm pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics.

My path to this field has been a unique blend of personal growth and academic pursuit. From a shy, introverted child, technology, particularly digital mapping, opened my world, transforming my fear of the unknown into a fascination with data and its immense possibilities. This marked the beginning of my journey into the realm of analytics, where every dataset tells a story waiting to be deciphered.

Encouraged by my father, I bravely stepped into the world of finance for my undergraduate studies, challenging gender norms in a male-dominated field. This experience fueled my interest in data analytics, particularly following a significant project in financial technology and banking risk analysis. The thrill of uncovering hidden patterns and contributing to knowledge in this field was exhilarating and deeply fulfilling.

The loss of my father to cancer was a pivotal moment in my life, further strengthening my determination to pursue my goals. His memory continues to inspire me as I break new ground in my field.

At Olin Business School, I've delved deep into business analytics and fintech, preparing myself to contribute meaningfully in these areas. Today, I'm passionate about uncovering insights in complex data sets and aspire to inspire others in the field of business analytics and fintech, just as I've been inspired by my experiences.
