This project provides a comprehensive analysis of player experiences on the Steam 
gaming platform, focusing on game reviews and user engagement. Through 
quantitative textual analysis, it identifies patterns in player feedback, highlighting the 
most popular and critically acclaimed games. The project also introduces a recommender 
system developed using Python, offering personalized game suggestions based on user 
preferences and review content. Insights from this project are pivotal for game 
developers and industry stakeholders, underlining the importance of user reviews in 
game development and marketing strategies. The project concludes with 
recommendations for enhancing user experience on Steam.

**Project Motivations**
-----------------
The comprehension of player experience frequently presents challenges, and it is not 
always evident to game developers which aspects of a game should be retained or discarded 
(Busurkina et al.,2020). From the player's perspective, in order to enhance their understanding 
of games and provide personalized game recommendations, the analysis of specific game 
reviews becomes instrumental. This approach can facilitate the development of superior quality 
games, while concurrently gaining insights into player psychology and gaming inclinations. 

The primary objective of our exploratory project was to discern the criteria by which individuals 
assess their gaming experiences, specifically through reviews posted on the Steam platform.
In our project, we try to understand the important features of game experience using 
quantitative textual analysis of game reviews on the Steam platform.
This project enhances the comprehension of mechanisms for consumer retention, 
corroborating the notion that reviews are instrumental in product improvement. Efficient 
utilization of reviews can boost sales, given that electronic word-of-mouth exerts a more 
favorable impact on purchasing decisions compared to traditional face-to-face word-of-mouth 
(Mankad et al., 2016).
